# [War] mourning line garbled when a town goes to no liege

When a liege's town is taken by neutrals (neutral players can tear down flags anywhere), the war announcement names the wrong party and leaves the liege's name blank.

## Steps to reproduce

Princess holds Marion (both capture points, after taking it from nobody). Set both capture points to faction 0 (what a neutral claim does), `send object <flagpole> SetFaction faction int 0`.

## Expected

"[War] Marion has fallen to the unfactioned. The flags of North Barloque fly at half-staff." (or the liege's name for whoever lost it, and 'no liege' for who took it).

## Actual

"[War] Marion has fallen to North Barloque.  The flags of  fly at half-staff." (the victor is shown as a place, and the mourning liege's name is empty). The preceding line, "Having claimed Deep Woods of Ileria, and West Merchant Way through Ilerian Woods, the unfactioned now also control the city of Marion!", is fine. The same Princess-to-Jonas-style change with a real victor reads correctly: "[War] Marion has fallen to Princess Kateriina.  The flags of West Jasper fly at half-staff." Look at FactionWorld.Mourn / fw_mourn's parameters when the victor is neutral.
