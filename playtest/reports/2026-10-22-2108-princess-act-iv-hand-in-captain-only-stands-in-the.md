# Princess Act IV hand-in captain only stands in the East Tower by day

The Envoy's Return (quest 308) says to hand the treaty to Cital ko'Manca in The East Tower. koctower.kod swaps its captain at game hours 8 and 20: Cital (KocatanCaptainGood) is there by day, Xacal ko'Ixca (the evil captain) at night. At night the quest's turn-in NPC isn't in the room, and nothing in the quest or the catalogue says to come back by day.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Princess campaign, Act IV, quest 308 accepted ("You are given the Princess's treaty to deliver"). 2. Go to The East Tower (RID 2013) at night (game hour outside 8-20): the room holds Xacal ko'Ixca ("!" offered), no Cital. 3. Set the hour to 8 (admin_hour 8): Cital ko'Manca appears ("?" to hand in) and the treaty is delivered.

## Expected

A player can finish the step at any time, or the quest text/log tells them the captain keeps the tower by day (and to nights, Xacal).

## Actual

quest_info: "Step 1: Take the treaty to the captain in Ko'catan, hand in to Cital ko'Manca ... The East Tower". At night the walker finds only Xacal ko'Ixca. A player could look for Cital for a long time. (The test used admin_hour 8, so the game hour is now earlier than it was.)
