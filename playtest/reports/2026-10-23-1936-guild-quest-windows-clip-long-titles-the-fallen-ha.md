# Guild quest windows clip long titles ("The Fallen Halls I: The Den of Shad..")

The quest window cuts the story quests' titles short with ".." ("The Fallen Halls II: The home of the .."), so the player can't read which hall the quest is about from the title; the objective line below does say it.

## Steps to reproduce

Talk to any Guild Master as a guild member at 80+ health with "A Guild's Calling" done, and open "The Fallen Halls I: The Den of Shadows" (quest 331) or II (332), both on accept and hand-in windows.

## Expected

The title fits, or wraps, or shortens to the hall's name.

## Actual

Title shows as "The Fallen Halls I: The Den of Shad .." and "The Fallen Halls II: The home of the .." in the window's title bar.
